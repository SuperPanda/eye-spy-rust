# An Eye Spy Game: Learning Rust and OpenCV with Intelligence - Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the structure and components of a preliminary version of the Eye Spy Rust project. The project aims to build a game of "eye spy" using computer vision (OpenCV) and machine learning (object detection) techniques. The goal is to develop a high-performance application that follows clean code principles, adapts pre-trained object detection models, and can process each step within a single frame.

## Project Structure

The project will be structured as follows:

- `src/`
  - `main.rs`: Entry point for the Eye Spy Rust application
  - `acceleration/`
    - `mod.rs`: Exports the `Acceleration` trait and any platform-specific acceleration modules
    - `amd/`
      - `mod.rs`: Contains the `AmdAccelerator` struct and its implementation
  - `video/`
    - `mod.rs`: Contains the `VideoCapture` struct and its implementation
  - `detection/`
    - `mod.rs`: Contains the `ObjectDetector` struct and its implementation

### src/main.rs

This file serves as the entry point for the Eye Spy Rust application. It will handle the following tasks:

- Import the required modules and structures
- Initialize the `AmdAccelerator` if it's available and process the video feed using hardware acceleration
- If the `AmdAccelerator` is not available, fall back to other means of processing the video feed
- Implement the main game loop and logic for the "eye spy" game

## Implementation Details

### Hardware Acceleration

The `AmdAccelerator` struct will be responsible for providing AMD-compatible hardware acceleration using the OpenCL framework. Its implementation will include:

- A method to check if an AMD-compatible accelerator is available
- Methods for initializing the accelerator, processing the video feed, and releasing resources after processing

### Video Capture

The `VideoCapture` struct will be responsible for managing the video feed from the camera. Its implementation will include:

- Methods for initializing the camera, capturing frames, resizing frames, and releasing resources after processing

### Object Detection

The `ObjectDetector` struct will be responsible for detecting objects in the video feed using pre-trained models. Its implementation will include:

- Methods for loading the pre-trained model, processing the video feed, and returning detection results

## Testing

Appropriate unit tests will be written for each module and struct in the project. These tests will ensure that each component functions correctly and adheres to the Rust best practices for testing.

## Git Versioning Strategy

To keep the commits as meaningful and informative as possible, the following git versioning strategy will be followed:

- Use descriptive and concise commit messages that explain the changes made in each commit
- Break down large features or refactorings into smaller, more manageable commits
- Keep commits focused on a single task or feature
- Use branches for developing new features or fixing bugs, and then merge them back into the main branch once they are complete and tested

By following this versioning strategy, the project's git history will be clean and easy to understand, making it easier for collaborators to follow the development process.

The README.md file will be updated to include information about the project structure, design, and git versioning strategy. Additional markdown documentation may be added as needed to provide more detailed information about specific components or features of the project.
