Eye Spy is a game that utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques for object detection. The project focuses on achieving maximum performance in object detection and video processing, ensuring that each step can be calculated within a single frame. This allows for a better understanding of the available "performance budget" that can be spent on adding more features to the game while maintaining smooth and responsive gameplay.
